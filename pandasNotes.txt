pandas is a python library for data analysis.
Core objects in pandas:
DataFrame
Series
A DataFrame is a table. It contains an array of individual entries, 
each of which has a certain value. Each entry corresponds to a row (or record) and a column.

We are using the pd.DataFrame() constructor to generate these DataFrame objects. 
The syntax for declaring a new one is a dictionary whose keys are the column names 
(Bob and Sue in this example), and whose values are a list of entries. 
This is the standard way of constructing a new DataFrame

A Series is, in essence, a single column of a DataFrame. 
So you can assign column values to the Series the same way as before, using an index parameter. 
However, a Series does not have a column name, it only has one overall name

ds = pd.Series([30, 45, 50], index=['Sales 2021', 'Sales 2022', 'Sales 2023'])

 It's helpful to think of a DataFrame as actually being just a bunch of Series "glued together".
