We use data to decide how to break the houses into two groups, 
and then again to determine the predicted price in each group. 
This step of capturing patterns from data is called fitting or training the model. 
The data used to fit the model is called the training data.

The first step in any machine learning project is familiarize yourself with the data. 
You'll use the Pandas library for this. 
Pandas is the primary tool data scientists use for exploring and manipulating data. 

The most important part of the Pandas library is the DataFrame. 
A DataFrame holds the type of data you might think of as a table. 
This is similar to a sheet in Excel, or a table in a SQL database.

We'll start by picking a few variables using our intuition. 
Later courses will show you statistical techniques to automatically prioritize variables.
